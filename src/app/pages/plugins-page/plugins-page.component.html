        <h1>Plugins</h1>
        <p>
          As a general rule, all custom and original plugins are completely free
          and open for anyone to use. However exact clones (PFA, miditrail,
          etc.) will be slightly modified to make them distinct from the
          original. I might release the exact looking copies, however BMT
          members are highly against them spreading anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am actively working on new plugins, and it is possible for anyone
          else to make a plugin themselves as well.

          The original render engine for Zenith. Any new render features in
          Zenith will always be supported first by this plugin.

      <app-plugin [imgUrl]="'assets/plugins/pfa.png'" [name]="'PFA+'">
        <p>
          An almost identical visual clone of the original program, with support
          for some exclusive features, including: same width notes, tick based
          rendering, gradient and transparency support with the midi track color
          event.

        <p>
          Very similar to the classic plugin, and more of a proof of concept
          than anything. Basically the classic version except without shading.
